Driving my truck home on a cold February night in West Texas, after eighteen hours on a construction site, the last thing I wanted was a flat tire. <pause=0.3s> The highway was a two lane rumor. The sky inked in hard.<pause=0.4s> When the tire thumped and dragged, I eased onto the shoulder, hazards ticking at the mesquite. <pause=0.3s> I left the engine idling for heat and told myself this was ten minutes of cold and cussing, nothing more.
<pause=0.8s>
As I cracked the door and started to climb down from the cab, the smell hit. "Bright." "Metallic." "Ozone!" Like a snapped wire! <pause=0.3s> The low hum I’d noticed became a single, low pitched note winding tighter and louder, coming closer until it found the truck and set the frame buzzing. <pause=0.3s> The vibration rode the doorframe and floorboard into my bones; my watch shivered against my wrist. <pause=0.3s> At its crest, the buzz locked into a steady shake—the whole truck trembling like whatever it was had settled right on top of me.
<pause=0.4s>
Everything in me went still. <pause=0.5s> Deer in the headlights still. <pause=0.5s> Rabbit under sage still. <pause=0.6s> I froze and let only my eyes move, sweeping the sky and the fence line, hunting the source of that climbing sound. <pause=0.4s> The part of me that measures things said stay still; <pause=0.5s> the older part lit the fuse to run. <pause=0.6s> My heart thumped hard enough to hear it.
<pause=0.4s>
I reached back toward the cab, <pause=0.3s> tried to pull the door in and make myself smaller. <pause=0.4s> The instant I moved, the engine coughed. The dash blinked. The headlights flattened the mesquite into paper cutouts! Then everything went dark. "No engine." "No lights." Just me, the hum, and the truck trembling under hard stars.
<pause=0.8s>
With the door closed, the hum muffled a notch, but the trembling stayed. <pause=0.5s> I leaned forward to peek out from the safety of the cab, chin resting on the steering wheel. <pause=0.3s> At first there was nothing to see, just a sense of weight where there shouldn’t be any.
<pause=0.6s>
Then the sky made a mistake. Stars blinked out along a line, three at a time, like someone dragging an eraser in a slow triangle. <pause=0.3s> A shape slid out of that absence. "Flat and black as wet slate!" Edges so clean they ate the starlight. <pause=0.3s> Three dull amber points marked its corners. <pause=0.3s> They didn’t blink: "No red", "no green", "no white". No running lights at all!.
<pause=0.4s>
It moved crosswind without banking. "It stopped without arriving." It turned in place the way a drawing turns when you rotate the paper. <pause=0.5s> A pale skin of light crawled the underside like frost finding a window. <pause=0.3s> The wind turbines out on the ridge hesitated between ticks; the air pressed flat, polite as a hand on a shoulder.
<pause=0.4s>
I checked my watch because that’s what I do when I don’t know what I’m looking at: two thirteen. <pause=0.7s> The hum lightened a hair and the triangle slipped along the seam of two thin clouds: "slid", "paused", slid again in a way that didn’t spend any motion, and then skimmed over the low hills and out of sight!
<pause=0.8s>
The hum was gone. I looked at my watch again and the second hand hadn’t moved. <pause=0.4s> I tapped the crystal once, twice, "nothing". <pause=0.6s> As if on cue, my phone in my right pocket buzzed twice like it wanted to help, and I realized I could’ve recorded the whole thing. Too late!.
<pause=0.4s>
I pulled my phone from my pocket. It ticked along the seconds as if nothing wrong had just chosen our stretch of sky: Bars flickered in and out. <pause=0.4s> I told myself, “Marcus, you don’t believe in UFOs.” “Marcus, you know they’re not real, right?”. I kept the patter going as I slid on my hard hat like I’d just shown up to inspect a site.
<pause=0.4s>
Then I slid out, stayed low like I was under fire, kept to the truck’s shadow, and worked my way around to the rear passenger door. <pause=0.4s> Every few steps I stopped to listen, eyes sweeping the sky and the fence line. <pause=0.4s> I set my boots soft on the gravel—egg shell careful—so the stones wouldn’t talk.
<pause=0.4s>
I opened the door, flipped the seat forward, and pulled the "factory jack", "the crank", "the lug wrench", and a small flashlight from the compartment behind it. <pause=0.4s> Each piece louder than I wanted in the cold. <pause=0.4s> I started back toward the flat and realized I’d left the passenger door open. <pause=0.6s> The wind remembered its job all at once and slammed it shut. <pause=0.8s> "I froze again." <pause=0.5s> Only my eyes moving as I scanned the dark.
<pause=0.4s>
After a few slow breaths to talk my limbic brain down—and get its grudging “all clear”—I aimed the flashlight at the rear tire, and there it was: a nail smiling from the tread.
<pause=0.4s>
With the flashlight clenched between my teeth, I wound the jack until the wheel sighed clear. <pause=0.4s> The nuts spun easy—like they wanted to help, and I almost laughed. <pause=0.5s> The world had made room for one thing not to make sense; everything else rushed in to be normal.
<pause=0.7s>
I muscled the spare up, hung it on the studs, spun the lugs, and snugged them in a star. <pause=0.4s> My breath turned the beam of my flashlight into a slow ghost. <pause=0.6s> I told myself, “No more ghosts tonight.” I was ready to go home. <pause=0.6s> That’s what I thought.
<pause=0.8s>
I climbed back into the truck and thumbed the starter. <pause=0.4s> The dash bloomed a soft green like a bar sign; the clock flashed two thirteen—then died. <pause=0.8s> "No crank." Just a single click from the relay, needles sinking to zero, and the dome light giving up. <pause=0.5s> The battery was out of juice.
<pause=0.6s>
I texted my wife that I wouldn’t make it home, "battery’s dead!" <pause=0.6s> It took two calls to reach Mike from the site. <pause=0.5s> He owed me a favor.
<pause=0.7s>
He said he’d bring cables; he was about an hour out. <pause=0.8s> To kill time, I sat in the cab scrolling my phone, looking for any local chatter about a UFO sighting out here. "Nothing!".
<pause=0.8s>
Headlights finally crested the rise—Mike’s truck. <pause=0.4s> I flagged him with a sweep of the flashlight. <pause=0.6s> Hoods up, clamps on—we jumped the battery, because that’s what you do when engines refuse to start. “You hit a deer?” he asked. “Something like that,” I said. He didn’t press; I didn’t volunteer.
<pause=0.7s>
The engine caught, the dash steadied, and we started back toward the site.
